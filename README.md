Basic JavaScript Game: Psychic-Game

The computer will randomly generated an alphabet letter. The user is going to press any key to guess the letter. There will be 9 guesses only. If the user has the correct guess, the user wins and will receive 1 point, and vice versa. 


### Reflection:
This is a game that uses basic JavaScript, such as `onkeyup` function, `Math.floor()`, `Math.random()`, `.push()`, `.join()`, `.textContent`, and `if - else if - else conditional statement`. 

I have encountered different issues and had many trials and errors. Even though, it may took me slightly longer than I thought, I think it helps me to understand the concept of the variables, syntaxes, methods, and functions.
